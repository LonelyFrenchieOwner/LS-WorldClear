# Overview;
***
I saw someone selling a script like this for $12, so I decided to make one for free, not just free, but better, with more options and with customizablilty. I hope y’all enjoy this and this benefits the people who need if, the code might not be the best, but it works.

# Features/Usage;

* **/worldclear command** - (Clears everything, props, vehicles, peds - Either instantly, or with a countdown customizable in the config)
* **/worldclear** peds/vehicles/props (Same thing as above, except it only focuses/clears a certain type)
* **Ace Perms** (Can be toggled on/off)
* **Custom NUI notification** (Can be toggled on/off)
* **Chat alerts** (Can be toggled on/off)

Fairly self explanaitory, support is provided though!
